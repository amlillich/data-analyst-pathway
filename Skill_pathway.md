# Data Analyst Skill Pathway

## Program Overview

This pathway is designed for career-switchers with no prior technical background who want to become job-ready data analysts. The curriculum progresses across four tiers: from foundational concepts to professional analytical practice. It uses **Python** for core analysis, **Tableau Public** for business dashboards, and **AI tools** for workflow acceleration.

Learners work within a consistent scenario: they are junior data analysts at **DataMart**, a mid-sized e-commerce company, and work with evolving customer-purchase datasets throughout the program. This approach builds both technical proficiency and authentic domain expertise.

### Design Philosophy

The pathway emphasizes:
* **Python** for scalable, reproducible analysis.
* **Tableau Public** for professional dashboarding and stakeholder communication.
* **AI assistants** for accelerating, but not replacing, analytical thinking.
* **Backwards design:** Learning objectives define instruction, activities, and assessments.
* A coherent dataset that grows in complexity, reducing cognitive load and reinforcing real-world analytical workflows.
